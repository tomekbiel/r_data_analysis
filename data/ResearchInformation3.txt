Description
The Student Performance Metrics Dataset provides a diverse collection of academic and non-academic attributes aimed at evaluating factors influencing student performance in higher education. It enables researchers to analyse relationships between student demographics, academic achievements, socio-economic factors, and extracurricular activities.

Dataset Attributes:
Department: The academic department the student is enrolled in (e.g., Computer Science, Business, etc.).
Gender: The gender of the student.
HSC: Score obtained in higher secondary education.
SSC: Score obtained in secondary school education.
Income: Monthly family income of their parents.
Hometown: The type of area where the student resides (e.g., urban, rural).
Computer: Proficiency level in computer usage.
Preparation: Time spent on study preparation outside class hours.
Gaming: Time spent on gaming activities daily.
Attendance: Regularity in class participation.
Job: Indicates if the student has a part-time job.
English: Proficiency in English communication skills.
Extra: Participation in extracurricular activities.
Semester: Current semester the student is enrolled in.
Last: Performance in the last semester.
Overall: Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).

Purpose and Use Cases:
The dataset serves as a resource for educational research, enabling trend analysis and the development of predictive models for academic success. Researchers can explore the impact of socioeconomic status, gender, and extracurricular activities on student performance. Potential use cases include building machine learning models to predict performance and analyzing factors that contribute to student success or dropout risks.

Limitations:
This dataset does not cover all potential influences on student performance, such as personal motivation or health. Future studies can enhance this dataset by including additional variables.
